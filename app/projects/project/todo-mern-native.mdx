# Todo MERN Native

This project is a mobile version of my Todo MERN App, built using React Native and Expo. It allows users to manage their tasks on the go, providing a seamless experience across both iOS and Android devices. The app connects to the same backend as the web version, ensuring that todos are synchronized across platforms.

Here is a link to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/angel33la/todo-mern-native). Feel free to check it out and see how the mobile app is implemented!

Here is a picture of the project in action:
