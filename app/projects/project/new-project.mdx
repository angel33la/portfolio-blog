# My Geolocation API Project

This project utilizes the Geolocation API to determine the user's location and display the weather on the website page. It provides an interactive experience where users can see their current position and get to see updates about the weather in their area. I made this very minimalist and plain to show the functionality of the Geolocation API without any distractions.

Here is a link to the [GitHub repository](https://angel33la.github.io/geolocationAPI/) where you can find the code and explore how the Geolocation API is implemented in this project. Feel free to check it out and see how it works!

Here is a picture of the project in action:
