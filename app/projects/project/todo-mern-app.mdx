# Todo MERN App

This project utilizes MERN stack. It has the ability to save your todos that are added to the site, as well as deleting them. There is a details/edits page that you can see all of your todos from and have the ability to edit and delete them. I am quite proud of this one and will use it for my own task tracking.

Here is a link to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/angel33la/todo-mern-app) and a link to the live site [Todo MERN App](https://todo-mern-app-e76a3997da5e.herokuapp.com/) where you can find the code and explore how the task tracker works in this project. Feel free to check it out and see how it works!
