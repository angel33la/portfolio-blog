Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a selection of projects that I've worked on, showcasing my skills and experience in web development. Each project highlights different aspects of my expertise, from front-end design to back-end functionality. I choose to utilize Next.js for my portfolio/blog site due to its powerful features, including server-side rendering, static site generation, and seamless integration with React. These capabilities allow me to create fast, dynamic, and SEO-friendly web applications that provide an excellent user experience. Also, adding a blog is quite thrilling to me because it has been something that I have been meaning to do and just was very nervous about the whole thing. Wanting to make everything perfect and turn out correctly was nerve racking. I was taking the leap to decide to do this on my own, but I am proud of the final result and excited to share it with you.

## Some Takeaways

Creating this portfolio has been a rewarding experience. I've learned a lot about web development, design principles, and the importance of user experience. Here are some key takeaways from the process:

- Using React and Next.js has significantly improved my development workflow, allowing me to build and deploy projects more efficiently. The more you use these tools, the more comfortable you become with their features and capabilities. I find that to be very true. I have learned so much in such a short time, and I am excited to continue exploring their potential.

- Designing a portfolio requires careful consideration of layout, color schemes, and typography to create a visually appealing and cohesive look. I aimed for a clean and modern design that reflects my personal style while ensuring readability and ease of navigation. 

- Adding a blog to my portfolio allows me to share my thoughts, experiences, and insights with others in the tech community. Writing about my projects and the challenges I've faced has helped me solidify my understanding of various concepts and technologies. I only hope to be able to keep up with this and continue to share more in the future. 

- Using Github Pages to host my portfolio has been a great choice. It provides a simple and cost-effective way to deploy my site, with the added benefit of version control through Git. This makes it easy to update and maintain my portfolio as I continue to grow and take on new projects.

## Conclusion

In the future I might decide to go and change all of this. I guess that is the excitement and privilege of having my own spot on the web. There is always room for growth and improvement. For now, I am proud of what I've accomplished and excited to share my work with you. I know that there are much better sites out there with extravagant designs and just so much more, but this is a start for me. I also wanted to keep things very minimalist and simple so that the focus remains on the content rather than flashy design elements.
